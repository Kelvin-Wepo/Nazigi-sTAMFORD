🔍 AFRICASTALKING LOGS ANALYSIS
================================

INCOMING MESSAGES (What you showed):
✅ Multiple "stamford" messages received
✅ From: +254711082300 and +254799489045
✅ To shortcode: 3854
✅ Link IDs present - messages are reaching AT

STATUS: ✅ INCOMING MESSAGES WORKING PERFECTLY

THE PROBLEM:
You showed INCOMING messages, but you need to check OUTGOING messages!

🎯 NEXT STEPS - CHECK OUTGOING MESSAGES:

1. Go to: https://account.africastalking.com/sms/logs

2. Look for the FILTER/TAB options at the top

3. Switch to "OUTGOING" or "SENT" messages

4. Search for phone numbers:
   - +254711082300
   - +254799489045

5. Check the columns:
   ✅ Date/Time - When sent
   ✅ Text - The message content (should be "Welcome to Nazigi...")
   ✅ To - The recipient (+254799489045)
   ✅ Status - DELIVERY STATUS (this is the key!)
   ✅ Cost - How much charged

EXPECTED OUTGOING MESSAGES:
You should see messages like:
"Welcome to Nazigi Stamford Bus Service! 🚌\n\nWould you like to receive updates..."

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN STATUS COLUMN:
- ✅ "Delivered" or "Sent" = GOOD (but you're not receiving?)
- ❌ "Failed" = Sender ID issue or number issue
- ❌ "Rejected" = Sender ID not approved
- ⏳ "Queued" = Still pending (wait a bit)
- ❌ "DeliveryFailure" = Carrier rejected

MOST LIKELY SCENARIOS:

Scenario 1: No outgoing messages at all
→ Callback URL not set or wrong
→ Flask app not processing correctly

Scenario 2: Outgoing messages with "Failed" or "Rejected" status
→ Sender ID issue (we removed it, restart Flask!)

Scenario 3: Outgoing messages "Delivered" but not received
→ Phone/carrier issue
→ Try different phone number

QUICK CHECK:
============

Tell me what you see in the OUTGOING section:
- Are there ANY outgoing messages?
- What is the STATUS of those messages?
- What time were they sent?

This will tell us exactly what's wrong!
